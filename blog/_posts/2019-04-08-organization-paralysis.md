Whenever I hit a roadblock in productivity, I find myself revisiting all of the many ways I try to be productive. During this process, I install a bunch of new *productivity* apps and uninstall any apps I deem to be a waste of time. *I’m looking at you, Twitter & Reddit.*

Soon after, I realize and think:
> I could’ve spent that time *actually* being productive. I always go back to my old apps and workflows anyways.  

Instead of continuing with this never-ending and unproductive cycle, I want to create a stricter workflow and outline use cases for each specific tool.

My goal is to minimize the amount of time I spend mulling over how to be productive, and *actually* being productive.

## The real struggle
I have many things I want to do, to work towards, and to remember. Unfortunately, I can’t do it all. With so limited time,  I need to find ways to do, work towards, and remember the **most** important things.

I’ve narrowed down what I need to organize my life to five points.

1. Tracking, prioritizing, and breaking down tasks
  * *Publish my first blog post*
  * *Distinguishing important long-term tasks vs. just urgent tasks*
2. Remembering future events
  * *My friend is having a birthday party on April 27*
3. Recalling past experiences
  * *How frantic was I when I broke production during my first internship?*
4. Maintaining habits
  * *Read a book for at least 15 minutes everyday*
5. Jotting down arbitrary thoughts
  * *Blog post ideas*, *The best start-up idea ever*

## The current solutions
As this was my first post on my *redesigned* website, I wanted to go into more detail about my workflow and how I specifically use these tools, but those separate sections ended up becoming much larger than I’d anticipated. I’ll go into more details in separate posts about each one.

In summary, I use the following:

1. A to-do list app, [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/), to solve 1 & 4
  * With a new twist, following my simplification of the GTD methodology
2. A calendar app, [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical), to solve 2
3. A journal app, [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com), to solve 3
4. A note app, [Bear](https://bear.app), to solve 5

For now, I’ll mark my task *write first blog post* as completed. Success!
