I play guitar. Whenever I want to learn how to play a song, I use a 
[guitar tab](https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/t/the_beatles/blackbird_ver5_tab.htm).
In the past, I would bookmark individual guitar tabs from around the web.
After a while, my bookmarks folder would be inundated with guitar tab links.

This either meant: 

1. Removing some bookmarks to tidy up the folder, or
2. Creating even *more* subfolders for bookmarks. **Nope**

So, I made [Tabbit](http://www.tabbit.xyz) to solve these problems:

1. Keeping track of the songs that I've learned to play sucks
2. Remembering which music sheets/tabs I used for those songs is even worse

It lets you aggregate music sheets and tabs from around the web into 
manageable and shareable lists. For example,
[check out my Tabbit list](http://www.tabbit.xyz/#/users/1/lists).

By this point, you're probably wondering, "how could it get better than that?"
Well, let me tell you. It's [open source](https://github.com/janclarin/tabbit)! 
It's built using AngularJS for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. 
It's currently hosted on Heroku and uses AWS S3 as cloud storage 
for storing users' music sheets if they prefer to 
[upload PDFs](https://tabbit.s3.amazonaws.com/kiss-the-rain-eqymp6hw5vid19m8wmb249529.pdf).
