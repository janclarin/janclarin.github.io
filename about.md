# Hi, I'm Jan!

I'm currently a software engineer at [Google](https://about.google) on the
[Shopping](https://shopping.google.com) team. Before this, I interned at
[Nureva](https://www.nureva.com) and
[Microsoft](/2016/10/18/interning-at-microsoft.html), and got my bachelor's
in computer science at the
[University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca).

I like playing tennis, practicing photography, reading books, learning piano,
watching anime, and riding my electric skateboard. All at once, of course.
