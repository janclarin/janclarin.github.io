# Hi, I'm Jan!

I like playing tennis, reading books, learning piano, watching anime,
taking photos, and riding my electric skateboard. All at once, of course.

I currently work as a software engineer at [Google](https://about.google),
and previously interned at [Nureva](https://www.nureva.com) and
[Microsoft](/blog/2016/10/18/interning-at-microsoft.html).
I got my B.S. Computer Science at the
[University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca).
