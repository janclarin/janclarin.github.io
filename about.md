# Hi, I'm Jan!

I like playing tennis, reading books, learning piano, watching anime,
taking photos, and riding my electric skateboard. All at once, of&nbsp;course.

I currently work as a software engineer at [Google](https://about.google),
and previously interned at [Nureva](https://www.nureva.com) and
[Microsoft](/2016/10/18/interning-at-microsoft.html).
I got my BSc Computer Science at the
[University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca).
