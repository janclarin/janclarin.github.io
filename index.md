# Hi, I'm Jan!

I'm a software engineer at [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/about) where I'm working
on NFT stuff. [wagmi](https://opensea.io/{{ site.social_links.opensea }}).

I previously worked at [Google](https://about.google) for 4 years on the
[Shopping](https://shopping.google.com) team and interned at
[Nureva](https://www.nureva.com) and
[Microsoft](/2016/10/18/interning-at-microsoft.html), and got my B.S. Computer
Science at the [University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca).

I like playing tennis, practicing photography, watching anime, and riding my
OneWheel around town. All at once, of course.
