# Hi, I'm Jan!

Current focus: [Bitcoin Runes](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-bitcoin-runes)

I'm currently in my web3 degen and builder phase. I was most recently a
senior software engineer at [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/about), an NFT
marketplace. I previously worked at [Google](https://about.google) on the Shopping team,
interned at [Microsoft](/blog/2016/10/18/interning-at-microsoft.html) and
[Nureva](https://www.nureva.com), and got my B.S. Computer Science at the
[University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca).

I like playing tennis, practicing photography, watching anime, and riding my
OneWheel around town. All at once, of course.
