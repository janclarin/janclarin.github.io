# Hi, I'm Jan!

I'm a software engineer at [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/about), the largest NFT
marketplace. wagmi.

I previously worked at [Google](https://about.google) on the Shopping team,
interned at [Microsoft](/blog/2016/10/18/interning-at-microsoft.html) and
[Nureva](https://www.nureva.com), and got my B.S. Computer Science at the
[University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca).

I like playing tennis, practicing photography, watching anime, and riding my
OneWheel around town. All at once, of course.
